==== 0.4
Version 0.4 brings several enhancements to the plugin.  The largest change is the adoption of a Facet-based approach to
managing the generation of Java source files from .proto files within a project.  This grants flexibility when working
with complex projects, as the facet-based approach supports generating Java files to a module-specific location, rather
than a single location per project.  This change will require users of previous versions of the plugin to reconfigure
their settings in order to generate sources.
