==== 0.5.7
* Fix an incompatibility with version 13.x due to an API method removal.
* Due to the API change, the minimum supported version is now IDEA 13.
* Fix an occasional error generating a safe package name for validating build item validity state.

==== 0.5.6
* Fixes a bug in detecting the state of the generated files. The bug meant that Java files would be generated even when there was no change to the .proto files. This should speed up compilation of projects significantly.

==== 0.5.5
* Changes to support IDEA 13.  The minimum version changed to IDEA 12.
* Minor bug fix for collapse all in the structure view for .proto files.

==== 0.5.4
* Bug fix release to fix bug when running under IDEA 11.

==== 0.5.3
* Idea 12 external compiler support
* Bug fixes
* Refinements, including to the proto-buffer facet detector

==== 0.5.1
* Idea 12 compatibility

==== 0.5a1
* Fixes a minor issue that sometimes caused generation of files when not necessary.

==== 0.5a1
* Support for using the plugin with Idea 11.

==== 0.4.1
* Structure view
* New icon for Protobuf files
* Various minor fixes

==== 0.4
Version 0.4 brings several enhancements to the plugin.  The largest change is the adoption of a Facet-based approach to
managing the generation of Java source files from .proto files within a project.  This grants flexibility when working
with complex projects, as the facet-based approach supports generating Java files to a module-specific location, rather
than a single location per project.  This change will require users of previous versions of the plugin to reconfigure
their settings in order to generate sources.
